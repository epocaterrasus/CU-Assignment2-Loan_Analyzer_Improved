# Loan Analyzer Application (Improved)


This project allows the user to enter a list of loans in .csv format ( using this format for column headers "Lender","Max Loan Amount","Max LTV","Max DTI","Min Credit Score","Interest Rate" and each row representing a specific loan offered by a financial institution) the program then goes to ask the user to input his Credit Score, Monthly Debt, Monthly Income, Desired Loan, and Home Value. Once the user has inputted this information it calculates the Debt-to-Income and Loan-to-Value ratios prints those values and then filters thru the list of of loans to determine which are fit based on the inputs and the ratios calculated, it prints the number of qualifying loans and then gives the user the possibility of saving the capability of saving these in a custom or default path.

User Stories:

* As a user of the application I want to be able to upload customized loan information so that I have the most up to date data that meets my specific requirements.
* As a user of the application I want to be able to input my credit conditions and prospective home purchase information so that the program can filter the loans that meet my conditions.
* As a user of the application I want to be able to save the output qualifying loans so that I can review them and revisit them in the future.
